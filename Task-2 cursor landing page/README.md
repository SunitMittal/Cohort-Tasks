# Cursor Landing Page

A landing page inspired by [Cursor](https://cursor.com), built with HTML and CSS. Showcases a hero section, features, testimonials, changelog, and footer with a dark theme and responsive layout.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- VS Code with Live Server extension

## Usage

- Open `index.html` in any web browser. Ensure the `Public/` folder is in the same directory so images load correctly.
- Edit `index.html` to change copy, links, section order, or add/remove sections.
- Edit `styles.css` to change colors (CSS variables in `:root`), typography, spacing, or layout.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5** — `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<article>` for structure and accessibility
